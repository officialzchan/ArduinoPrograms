MP3 RGB SWITCHER

Simple program for use with an Arduino, DFPlayer (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1121.html, wiring diagram here: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299), speaker, RGB Neopixel strip, and a button.
There are two sound files on the sd card. After start up, pressing the button will play the first sound file, and cycle the LEDs to on (all green by default). Pressing the button again will play the second sound file, and turn the lights off. This repeats for each button press.
